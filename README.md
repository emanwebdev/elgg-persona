Persona for Elgg
================

By Ben Werdmuller (http://benwerd.com/)

## Persona for your Elgg site ##

This plugin, for Elgg 1.8+, adds a Persona login button to your Elgg site. 

This plugin allows your users to optionally use Persona to log into your Elgg site. 

All they need is an email address - it\'s arguably easier than Elgg\'s built-in authentication!

## So what's Persona? ##

Persona is an easy-to-use authentication standard created by Mozilla. 

Persona is a simple authentication mechanism created by Mozilla, 
inspired by one-click authentication mechanisms like Facebook Connect and Twitter authentication. 

The difference is that Persona is designed to be decentralized, so that no company is able to track their users across the entire web. It's also super simple and beautifully designed.

## Instructions ##

* Install the plugin as normal (place the /persona/ folder in your /mod/ directory)
* Switch on Persona authentication in the plugin's settings in your Elgg administration panel.
