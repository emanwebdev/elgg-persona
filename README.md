# Persona for your Elgg site #

This plugin, for Elgg 1.8+, adds a Persona login button to your Elgg site.

# Instructions #

Install the plugin as normal (place the /persona/ folder in your /mod/ directory), and then switch on Persona authentication in the plugin's settings in your Elgg administration panel.

# What is Persona? #

Persona is a simple authentication mechanism created by Mozilla, inspired by one-click authentication mechanisms like Facebook Connect and Twitter authentication. The difference is that Persona is designed to be decentralized, so that no company is able to track their users across the entire web. It's also super simple and beautifully designed.
